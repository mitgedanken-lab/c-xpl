## Introduction

XPL is an easy to embed and extend scripting programming language. It's implemented in a single C header file within only several hundreds lines of code; and runs almost as fast as `strlen()`. It contains only a few high frequently used features like: `if-then-elseif-else-endif`, `yield`, scripting interface invoking etc. Registering the scripting interface is as easy as writing a common array. The design principle of XPL is doing 80% of work with 20% of core code, doing left work with few extended scripting interface. It's aimed to be a thin and light weight scripting solution.

There's no build dependency, no heap allocation; just a single pass parsing + running.
